Explore and Summarize Data project

Mohammed Zayed Al-Otaibi



Introduction:
In this project, I used R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies*.



Dataset:
This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent)**.


Data Visualisation & Exploring:
- I explored the data by using the histogram [for all variables] and see the data distribution.
- I explored the data by using the scatter plot [for all variables] to see the relationship between some variables.
- I used Explored many variables by using scatter plot to see relationship between 3 varialbes density, alcohol, and classify of wine.


After then:
I wrote a summary and choose 3 visualizations with a report about the Reflection.
